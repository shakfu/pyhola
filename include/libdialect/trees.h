    //! @note  Before adding each Node to the given Graph G we check whether G already has a Node that reports
    //!        the same ID; if it does, we do not add the Node. This is useful so that root nodes are not
    //!        overwritten when reattaching peeled trees to a core graph.

    //! @param[in] alignRoot  Say whether an alignment constraint should be set between the root node and
    //!                       a centre node (if present) in the first rank. For example, this should be set
    //!                       false in the case of a peeled tree being reattached with ordinal placement direction.

    //!         the given graph G. Set constraints to keep the buffer nodes in place.
    //! @param[out] G  The Graph to which the Nodes and constraints are to be added.
