/**
 * @brief The ExpansionManager class
 *
    An instance of this class is meant to manage the generation of nonoverlap
    constraints, when making room for a TreePlacement in a Face of a planar
    orthogonal layout.

    The idea is that we choose strategic "goal points" in the face, and compute
    the line segments from the tree's attachment point to these goal points.
    We can then use these line segments to determine the nonoverlap constraints
    by pushing everything on one side of the line to one side, and everything
    on the other side of the line to the other side.

    A TreePlacement has both a "placement direction" dp, and a "growth
    direction" dg. The former is any compass point, cardinal or ordinal, while
    the latter must be cardinal. Expansion constraints are said to be "axial"
    when they operate in the dimension to which dg belongs, and to be
    "transverse" when they operate in the complementary dimension.
    For example if dg is NORTH, then SepCo's in the y-dim are axial,
    while those in the x-dim are transverse.

    Similarly, goal points are called axial or transverse according to the type
    of constraints they generate. If the placement direction dp is cardinal, then
    there is one transverse goal point, and there are two axial goal poitns.
    If the placement direction dp is ordinal, there there is one transverse and
    one axial goal point.

    For example, for a north-growing tree that was also placed north, see the
    figure on the left, below. Rooted at the "o", the three goal points are marked
    by "a", "b", "c". Goal point "a" is the one transverse goal point, since it will
    generate expansion constraints operating left and right, i.e. in the x-dimension.
    Meanwhile points "b" and "c" are the two axial goal points, since they will
    generate expansion constraints operating up and down, i.e. in the y-dimension.

                ---a---         a-------
               |      |         |      |
               |      |         |      |
               c---o--b         o------b

    The figure on the right shows the two goal points for a north-growing tree that
    was placed north-east. Here there is one transverse goal point ("a"), and one
    axial ("b").

    For each goal point the ExpansionManager constructs an ExpansionGoal object,
    which in turn uses the ContainedSegment class to generate expansion constraints.

    Note: In an earlier version of HOLA (the Python version from 2015), this process
    was much more complex, potentially considering many more goal points, spanning
    face concavities. In those caes libavoid was used to find an orthogonal route
    to the goal point, and the segments of the route were used to select the expansion
    constraints. That system allowed us to consider all possible ways of expanding
    a face. The present system is faster and simpler, and is deemed to produce
    results of equal quality.
